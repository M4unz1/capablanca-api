   1. Tokens should be stored in local storage
   2. Tokens should be restored on page reload
   3. Access token should be passed in the network requests
   4. After expiration access token should be updated by refresh token if the last one is presented
   5. React components should have access to the auth information to render appropriate UI
   6. The solution should be made with pure React (without Redux, thunk, etc..)
